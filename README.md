# Medical Image Processing Desktop Application

## Project Description

This project is a desktop application for processing digital medical images such as X-rays and MRIs for hospitals. It is developed using Python and PyQt5. The application takes user information including ID number, name, age, gender, marital status, and either an MR or X-ray image as input. It then processes the received image and displays the result. Additionally, it provides the option to print the user information along with the results to a PDF file.
